      <h3>Workshops Project – Scan to BIM (LOD 300)</h3>
      <p><strong>Location:</strong> Europe Based</p>
      <p><strong>Project Type:</strong> Existing Building / Scan to BIM</p>
      <p>
        This Scan to BIM project focused on developing an accurate BIM model from laser scan point cloud data
        exclusively to understand existing spaces for renovation planning. The scope of work was limited to
        model creation only, with no requirement for construction drawings or documentation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Revit model was developed to reflect existing as-built conditions, enabling stakeholders to visualize
        spatial relationships, assess constraints, and evaluate renovation feasibility. Strong emphasis was placed
        on modeling accuracy, correct level setup, and clean BIM practices to support reliable design decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The model served as a digital reference for space planning and early-stage coordination, helping teams
        efficiently analyze existing conditions before progressing into detailed design phases.

      <h3>Scan to BIM Renovation Study – Discipline Worksets (LOD 300)</h3>
      <p><strong>Location:</strong> Europe Based</p>
      <p><strong>Project Type:</strong> Existing Building / Scan to BIM</p>
      <p>
        This Scan to BIM renovation study project involved creating a coordinated BIM model from laser scan
        point cloud data to support renovation space analysis. The model was developed without producing drawings
        and was organized using discipline-based worksets to clearly separate Architectural, Structural, and MEP elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        The primary objective was to provide a clear understanding of existing spatial conditions and system layouts
        for renovation planning. Discipline-wise worksets improved model clarity, coordination readiness, and future
        usability for design development and clash coordination.
      </p>
      <p>
        The BIM model enabled stakeholders to visualize spatial relationships, identify constraints between systems,
        and make informed renovation decisions during early design stages.
